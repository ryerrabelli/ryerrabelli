## File Structure
My python projects usually follow the same general file structure:
* _`<main_folder_name>`_
  * `docs/`
    * [`LICENSE.txt`](../docs/LICENSE.txt)
    * [`README.md`](../docs/LICENSE.txt)         <- _.rst file type preferred in python, but .md is more common overall_
  * `src/`  <- _dedicated `src` folder is not always done but recommended for compatibility_
    * _`<module_name>`_       <- _often the same name as the main folder_
      * [`__init__.py`](../src/***/__init__.py)       <- _an empty file can be all that's needed at times. However, importing items here can be useful as they will be accessible to any file that is importing the overall module_
      * [`_version.py`](../src/***/_version.py)       <- _autogenerated by versioneer using info from setup.cfg [^1]_
      * [`main.py`](../src/***/main.py)               <- _entry point file to be run_
      * [`utils.py`](../src/***/utils.py)  
      * _`<any other python files>`_
    * `scripts/`        <- _optional, would contain `.sh` files in linux/mac_
      * [`save_ipynb.sh`](../src/scripts/save_ipynb.sh)       <- _a script that can be used to save the jupyter notebook files as .py and .html as well, which is easier for git version control and general viewing_
      * [`save_ipynb.sh`](../src/scripts/save_ipynb.sh)       <- _a script that creates an image file for your email address. This allows you to include it in the markdown file without having it easily accessible to web scrapers (to prevent email spam)_
    * `notebooks/`       <- _jupyter/colab notebooks_
  * `data/`       <- _data files i.e. .csv, jpg, etc  used as input for the code. This includes intermediate files which are output from one piece of code, but used as input for other pieces_
  * `outputs/`       <- _figures and other files which are terminal outputs from the code i.e. used solely for non-code usage and not as input for other code files_
  * [`versioneer.py`](../versioneer.py)       <- _must be here in the top level folder [^1]_
  * [`setup.py`](../setup.py)            <- _must be here in the top level folder_ [^2]
  * [`setup.cfg`](../setup.cfg)           <- _must be here in the top level folder_ [^2]
  * [`requirements.txt`](../requirements.txt)    <- _must be here in the top level folder_ [^3]
  * [`MANIFEST.in`](../MANIFEST.in)         <- _Not strictly required_
  * `build/`      <- _optional_
  * `dist/`       <- _optional, would usually contain .egg, .whl, .tar.gz, etc files_
  * `examples/`   <- _optional_
  * `lib/`        <- _optional_
  * `tests/`      <- _optional, would contain python files_

[^1]: Unlike `versioneer.py`, `_version.py` does not have to be on the top level folder, which I prefer so it does not clutter the project and can be more easily accessed in the project. setup.cfg should be changed so that the file path of the src/\<module\>, where `_version.py` will be kept is given
[^2]: Some applications use only one- a setup.py or setup.cfg, but versioneer prefers both.
[^3]: Can be autogenerated by PyCharm. Will not be blank as must have versioneer at least.
